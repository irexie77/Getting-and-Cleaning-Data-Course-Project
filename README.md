# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository is a **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project** for Coursera. The goal is to be able to create a tidy data that can be used for future analysis. 
The database being used is taken from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files
The script `run_analysis.R` is obtained by doing the following:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriate labeling of the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Then we get the result which is the `tidyDATA.txt` file.
